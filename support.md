Timeline Earth needs your support. The crack house is falling apart.

You need to go join the [Patreon](https://patreon.com/timelineearth). Not only will you get exclusive episodes, but it's barely $1.00 per host per month. How hard is that? 

If you're too poor or Jewish to give each host a measly $0.26 per episode, then at least go subscribe to the podcast on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2TqT6kcwVFRSAQP8BUlH58?si=288dd2d7ab93469d) and [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/timeline-earth/id1356641195).

Regardless, share the show with everyone you know that's not a smoothbrain.
